Counselling  Management System 1. Introduction This report details the design of a  Counselling Management System . The primary tool used for this project is a  Logical Data Flow Diagram (DFD) . This type of diagram focuses on the business operations of the system, showing how information flows between its processes, the users, and its data storage. 1  The logical approach is used to ensure a clear understanding of what the system must do before any technical decisions are made. 2. Requirements Gathering &amp; Case Study The system's requirements were gathered by studying the needs of a university  Counselling  office. This analysis revealed the three primary users, or  External Entities , who interact with the system. Students/Clients:  Need to log in, manage their personal details, and request  Counselling  appointments. Counsel l ors:  Need to log in, view their schedules, write confidential session notes, and record important details. Secretar y :  Need to log in to schedule appointments for both students and counselors and create administrative reports. The  case study  for this project is the  Counselling  Management System  itself. The system is designed to streamline operations by handling tasks automatically, keeping records safe, and improving communication among staff. 3. D ata  F low  D iagram  &amp;  Use Case Analysis The D ata  F low  D iagram  for this system shows its internal workings. It breaks the system into key  processes  and details how information moves between them and the  data stores . A  use case  was created for a core function, illustrating the flow of a typical user interaction. Use Case: Manage  Counselling  Appointment Primary Actor:  Student/Client Supporting Actors:  Counsel l or, Secretary Goal:  To allow students to efficiently request and attend  Counselling  sessions. Precondition The student is registered in the system and has valid login credentials Main Flow: The student logs into the system. The student views available  Counselling  slots. The student selects  the preferred  date and time. The system checks the counse l lor's schedule. The secretary or the system confirms the appointment. The student receives  confirmation . Alternative Flow: If the chosen slot is unavailable, the system suggests another slot. If login fails, the student is prompted to retry with the correct details. Postcondition: The appointment details are stored in the  Appointment Database . The counselor’s schedule is updated accordingly. 4. D ata  F low  D iagram  Components Level 0 (Context Diagram) The system is first represented as a single process, the  " Counselling  System."  This high-level diagram connects to the three external entities ( Student/Client ,  Counsel l or ,  Secretary ) with labeled arrows showing the main data that flows in and out. This makes it easier to see the overall picture before breaking it down into more detail in the Level 1 D ata  F low  D iagram . Counselling  Data Flow Diagram (Level 0) Level 1 (Detailed Diagram) The Level 1 D ata  F low Diagram  shows what happens inside the system step-by-step. The system has five important  processes  and five  data stores . Main Processes 1.0 User Authentication  – Verifies user login requests against the database. 2.0 Manage Client Records  – Handles all personal information for students and staff. 3.0 Manage Appointments  – Manages the booking, rescheduling, and canceling of meetings. 4.0  Counselling  Session Management  – Allows  counsellor s to record session notes. 5.0 Generate Reports  – Produces reports for the secretary. Data Stores D1: User Credentials DB  – Stores usernames and passwords. D2: Client DB  – Stores student profile details. D3: Appointments DB  – Saves all appointment information. D4: Session Notes DB  – A highly secure, private storage area for counseling notes. D5: Reports DB  – Stores all generated reports. The arrows on the diagram show how data flows between the users, the processes, and the data stores.   Every action typically has two parts: a request and a response. For example, a student's Login Request is sent to the system, which checks the  User Credentials DB  and then sends back a Login Success or Failure message.        </w:r><w:r w:rsidR="009D67C7" w:rsidRPr="009D67C7"><w:rPr><w:rFonts w:ascii="Times New Roman" w:hAnsi="Times New Roman" w:cs="Times New Roman"/><w:b w:val="0"/><w:bCs w:val="0"/><w:i/><w:iCs/><w:color w:val="auto"/><w:sz w:val="16"/><w:szCs w:val="16"/></w:rPr><w:t>Level 1 Data Flow Diagram 4.  Explanation of Connections Process 1: Authentication External entities (Student/Client, Counselor, Secretary) send login requests. The system checks credentials against D1: User Accounts. If correct, access is  granted,  and the user can move on to other processes. Process 2: Manage Client Records Counselors and secretaries can add or update client records. Data is stored in D2: Client Records. Updated details can later be used in sessions or for reports. Process 3: Manage Appointments Students request or view appointments. Secretaries confirm and store details in D3: Appointments. Appointment info flows to counselors so they can prepare for sessions. Process 4: Conduct Sessions Counselors record notes and session details. Notes are securely stored in D4: Session Notes (only counselors can access this). If a referral is needed, the system alerts the secretary immediately. Process 5: Generate Reports The secretary retrieves data from Appointments (D3), Client Records (D2), and  Records  (D5). Reports such as Appointment Statistics and Audit Logs are generated. This  help  improve accountability and efficiency in the office . Overall Flow Login → Manage Records/Appointments → Conduct Sessions → Generate Reports. All processes are linked by the data stores (D1–D5). NB:  External entities (students, counselors, secretary) interact through the processes, never directly with the data stores. 6 . Conclusion The D ata  F low  D iagram  of the  Counselling  Management System provides a clear, business-oriented view of how data flows. The design effectively solves common problems faced in  Counselling  centers, such as disorganized scheduling and a lack of proper record-keeping. By handling tasks automatically, keeping information secure, and providing clear reports,  the system improves efficiency, builds accountability, and enhances the  counselling  experience for both students and staff.
